This is a PC casual game. Player controls the figure using keyborad, whether let it jump or squat, to pass each coming blocks. 

If the player fails to avoid the blocks for several times, game is over.

Techniques:

1. Animation and its frames.

2. Time sensitive game development: use delta time to coordinate the updates of each component.

3. This project has an excellent code structure. Each components are written in its own class. The dependencies among them are well organized in the code.
